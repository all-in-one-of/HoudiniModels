# HoudiniModels
3D Models created via Houdini 3D Modeling software

``HoudiniModels`` is a collection of my beginner projects on the Houdini 3D Modeling software. 

Project ``ws_spiro`` is assignment from the [SideFX website.](https://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2961&Itemid=410)

I have no formal training using the software nor do I claim to be an expert with Houdini.
